# RapidAPI Testing GitHub Actions

This GitHub Action allows you to trigger the execution of [RapidAPI Testing](https://rapidapi.com/testing) tests. This is especially useful
during CI/CD to ensure new deployments are functioning as expected.

## Complete example

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  run_api_test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Execute RapidAPI API Tests
    steps:
    - name: Execute Tests
      id: tstExec
      uses: RapidAPI/gh-api-testing-trigger@v0.0.3
      with:
        test: 'YOUR_TEST_ID'
        location: 'AWS-US-WEST-2'
        environment: 'ENV_ID(OPTIONAL)'
    - name: Show Results
      run: echo "The test took ${{ steps.tstExec.outputs.time }}ms to run"; echo "The test result was ${{ steps.tstExec.outputs.computedStatus }}"; echo "View Report - ${{ steps.tstExec.outputs.reportUrl }}"
```
